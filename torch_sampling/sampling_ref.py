    View the output of the forward pass as a sparse vector q.  You can view the
    forward pass as implementing: q = z p, where z is a sparse vector whose
    *expected* value is [1,1,..].  Because the expected value of z does not change

    we can express z as just q / p, this becomes:
          p_grad = q / p * output_grad
    where q is the sparse output of the forward pass.  In log-space, this is just
    equivalent to log_p_grad = log_output_grad.
    In non-log space, division by p could lead to infinite output if p is zero;
    in the forward pass we smoothed p by adding 2**-(num_bits_per_sample), and
